# 27/02/2018 - 11th Lecture

## Idle Scans and Decoys

We talked in length about TCP Idle Scans - definitely one of the coolest scans out there! It involves Zombies :).

Idle scans can be initiated with `nmap`'s `-sI` flag.

We also talked about Decoys and how attackers may use those to hide in plain sight

##  Linux Command Line

We explained how to use the `&&` and `||` bash operations to conditionally
execute commands.

We explained why we need the Shebang on bash scripts - adding a "#!/usr/bin/bash"
or "#!/usr/bin/env bash" to the beginning of a bash script.


We extracted the url of `flag_4x3_svg` from "https://ipfox.io/flags/4x3/us.svg" using
`cut` and `grep` and then piped it to `wget` to download.

Congrats! Your first [Capture the Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security).

## Misc

We talked about Short-wave propagation (RTL-SDR), number stations, listening to
airplane messages. We also talked about using `Alfa` for Wi-Fi hacking.
